***Collatz Conjecture***

[Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_Conjecture)

This is a mathematical conjecture, you take a number, if this number is odd you divide it by two, if it is odd you multiple it by 3 and add 1. The problem is it is unknown if you will always get to 1 with all positive integers.
